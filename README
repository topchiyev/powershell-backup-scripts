These scripts contain calls to appropriate scripts for each backed up host.
They are intended to be run via Windows Task Scheduler on a timed basis:
ALL_BACKUP.ps1
ALL_CLEANUP.ps1

Each host require 4 scripts:
{HOSTNAME}_FILE_backup.ps1
{HOSTNAME}_MSSQL_backup.ps1
{HOSTNAME}_FILE_cleanup.ps1
{HOSTNAME}_MSSQL_cleanup.ps1

Host scripts call these scripts which do the job:

MAKE_FILE_BACKUP.ps1 - Connects to the remote server via Powershell Session, makes a ZIP archive on an SMB share, copies it to the backup store.
MAKE_MSSQL_BACKUP.ps1 - Connects to the MSSQL server, makes a ZIP archive in the SMB share, copies it to the backup store.
MAKE_FILE_CLEANUP.ps1 - Iterates over backups in the backup store, deletes all except: leaves all backups of current month, last backup of each month of current year, last backup of each year
MAKE_MSSQL_CLEANUP.ps1 - Iterates over backups in the backup store, deletes all except: leaves all backups of current month, last backup of each month of current year, last backup of each year
